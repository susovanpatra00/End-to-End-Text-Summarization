Libraries Used -
1. ConfigBox - ConfigBox is a flexible and convenient dictionary-like container from the box library. It 
            is often used in Python projects for managing configuration settings. It is used for ease of use.

2. ensure_annotations - The ensure_annotations decorator from the ensure library is used to enforce type 
            annotations at runtime. This helps to ensure that the types of the arguments and return values 
            of a function match the specified type annotations.
