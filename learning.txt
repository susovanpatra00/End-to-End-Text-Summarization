1. Github Setup
2. Project Template Creation
3. Project Setup & Requirements Installation
4. Logging, Utils & Exception module
5. Project Workflows
6. All component Notebook Experiment
7. All component Modular code Implementation
8. Training Pipeline
9. Prediction Pipeline & User App Creation
10. CI/CD Deployment on AWS




## Workflows
1. Update config.yaml 
2. Update params.yaml
3. Update entity
4. Update configuration manager inside src/config
5. Update components
6. Update pipeline
7. Update main.py
8. Update app.py


First update the flow in config.yaml file (lets say data_ingestion), then go to the entity and create the 
return type of the same ones which are specified in config.yaml

In constant we will keep the path of the yaml files



Libraries Used -
1. ConfigBox - ConfigBox is a flexible and convenient dictionary-like container from the box library. It 
            is often used in Python projects for managing configuration settings. It is used for ease of use.

2. ensure_annotations - The ensure_annotations decorator from the ensure library is used to enforce type 
            annotations at runtime. This helps to ensure that the types of the arguments and return values 
            of a function match the specified type annotations.

3. 












## entity - It is nothing but the return type of a function.
